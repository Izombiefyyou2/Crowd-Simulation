# Crowd-Simulation
For this project i've decided to research more into crowd simulation and how it can be handled in various ways, more specifically using the OCEAN model (a.k.a the big five)
Using an already created excercise around flocking i could implement this by giving certain agents certain personality differences.
A simplified example could be making some of my agents introverted or extroverted and thus changing their behavior accordingly.
## the OCEAN model
The OCEAN model (big five) looks at the five traits that serve as the building blocks of personality.
This example shows just exactly what each of the five traits means for how they act depending on if they have a high or low amount of said trait.
